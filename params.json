It allows Arduino projects to keep accurate time easily.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nPlace the `DS1302` directory in the `libraries` subdirectory of your Arduino\r\nsketch directory. On OS X, for example, your sketch directory might be:\r\n\r\n    /Users/you/Documents/Arduino\r\n\r\nIn that case, you should put the `DS1302` directory at:\r\n\r\n    /Users/you/Documents/Arduino/libraries/DS1302\r\n\r\nA simple example is included with the code.\r\n","tagline":"Arduino library for the DS1302 Real Time Clock chip","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
